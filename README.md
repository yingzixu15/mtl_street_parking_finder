There are some typos/text mismatch in the original data that was manually fixed before processing with script as it makes my life easier. The following are the changes (case insensitive):
- avil -> avril
- mrs -> mars
- dÃ©c -> dec

You can use `replace all` to get the same base data as mine to use for the scripts.
